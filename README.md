# ðŸ“ˆ Case Study: Reducing Repeat Contacts in Fintech Support Operations

**Role Targeted**: Data Analyst â€“ Customer Service Operations  
**Company**: OKX (Fintech & Crypto Exchange Platform)  
**Focus Areas**: Operational Efficiency | Root Cause Analysis | Customer Support Data | Process Optimization | Fintech User Behavior  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Background

In a simulated high-volume fintech support environment inspired by OKX, I analyzed over **35,000+ anonymized support tickets** across 3 months.  
The objective: **Identify and reduce repeat contacts**, improve **first-time resolution (FTR)**, and enhance **customer experience**.

**Tech Stack**  
- `SQL` â€“ Data extraction & anomaly detection  
- `Tableau` â€“ Funnel & metric visualization  
- `Python (Pandas)` â€“ Data Generation  
- `Excel` â€“ Efficiency & churn modeling

## ðŸ“ˆ Problem Statement

- âœ… **Repeat Contacts Increased**: 22% rise within 10 days after ticket resolution  
- âœ… **CSAT Dropped**: From 4.5 â†’ 4.0 during the same period  
- âœ… **Top Repeat Categories**:
  - Wallet Transactions: ~35%
  - KYC Verification: ~26%

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

### 1. Wallet-related issues dominate repeat contacts 
- Wallet-related tickets account for **~35% of all repeat contacts**.
- Making them the single biggest driver of re-engagement.

### 2. Noticeable post-release surge
- In Week 2 after a product release, repeat contacts for Wallet issues spiked around **65%**.
- Suggesting product changes or communication gaps led to an influx of inquiries.

### 3. Wallet issues lag in resolution quality
- Wallet tickets have the lowest FTR rate **(~65%)** and an **average CSAT of 3.69/5**.
- Indicating users aren't getting clear or complete answers on the first try.

## ðŸ“ˆ Recommendations

| Action | Purpose | Estimated Impact |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| âœ… Create a Wallet Issue Taskforce (CS + Product + Ops) | Push fixes faster | â†“ Wallet tickets by ~35% |
| âœ… Push Notifications for Known Issues | Reduce "status-chasing" calls | Prevent future Week 2-style surges |
| âœ… Run Wallet Scenarios (refunds, withdrawals, failed transactions) | Boost FTR Training | â†‘ FTR by ~15% |
| âœ… Build a "Repeat Contact Playbook" | Create a repeatable framework for all areas, not just Wallet | + Agent productivity |

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Projected Outcomes

| Metric | Before | After (Projected) |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Repeat Contact Rate | 22% | â†“ 30â€“40% |
| First-Time Resolution | 66% (Wallet) | â†‘ 10â€“20% |
| CSAT | 4.0 | â†‘ 4.4+ |
| Cost per Ticket | High (due to loops) | â†“ ~18% |

## ðŸ“ˆ OKX Role Fit

- âœ… Worked with CRM-like ticket structures for issue categorisation, resolution tracking, and escalation mapping (Zendesk equivalent)
- âœ… Analysed KYC and wallet transaction pain points, simulating payment issue flows tied to risk operations
- âœ… Applied Lean-like continuous improvement logic to reduce repeat contacts and improve CSAT/FTR through data-backed interventions

## ðŸ“ˆ Tools & Skills Applied

- SQL (joins, window functions, anomaly queries)  
- Tableau (funnels, dashboards, segmentation)  
- Python (Pandas)
- CRM/Ticketing Knowledge (Zendesk, Salesforce - tagging logic, FTR Status, CSAT)
- Continuous Improvement / Lean Six Sigma Thinking (Mapping workflow, pinpointed issues & fixes to improve FTR)
- Risk & Payment Issue Exposure 
- Fintech User Behaviour & Operational Strategy

## ðŸ“ˆ Notes

This case study demonstrates my ability to:
- Dive deep into support metrics and detect inefficiencies
- Translate data into business & product recommendations
- Operate at the intersection of **analytics, service design, and product feedback loops**
