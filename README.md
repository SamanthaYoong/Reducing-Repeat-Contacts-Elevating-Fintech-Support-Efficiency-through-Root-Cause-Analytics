# 📈 Case Study: Reducing Repeat Contacts in Fintech Support Operations

**Role Targeted**: Data Analyst – Customer Service Operations  
**Company**: OKX (Fintech & Crypto Exchange Platform)  
**Focus Areas**: Operational Efficiency | Root Cause Analysis | Customer Support Data | Process Optimization | Fintech User Behavior  

---

## 📈 Background

In a simulated high-volume fintech support environment inspired by OKX, I analyzed over **35,000+ anonymized support tickets** across 3 months.  
The objective: **Identify and reduce repeat contacts**, improve **first-time resolution (FTR)**, and enhance **customer experience**.

**Tech Stack**  
- `SQL` – Data extraction & anomaly detection  
- `Tableau` – Funnel & metric visualization  
- `Python (Pandas)` – Trend analysis  
- `Excel` – Efficiency & churn modeling  

---

## 📈 Problem Statement

- 📈 **Repeat Contacts Increased**: 22% rise within 10 days after ticket resolution  
- 😞 **CSAT Dropped**: From 4.3 → 3.6 during the same period  
- 🔁 **Top Repeat Categories**:
  - Wallet Transactions: 41%
  - KYC Verification: 31%

---

## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. Spike Analysis (SQL)
- Detected post-release spike in wallet-related contacts due to **delayed refund notifications**
- Caused **~41% of repeat contacts**

### 2. Funnel Drop-off (Tableau)
- **KYC support** had the lowest FTR: **38%** vs. average 64%
- Friction mainly from lack of real-time status updates

### 3. Policy Consistency (NLP Analysis)
- Found **28% script inconsistency** in agent replies
- Led to mixed messages & recontacts

## 📈 Recommendations

| Action | Purpose | Estimated Impact |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| 🔔 Auto-notification for wallet refunds | Reduce uncertainty & loops | ↓ Wallet tickets by ~35% |
| 👤 KYC Real-time Tracker UI | Increase transparency | ↑ FTR by 20% |
| 🧾 Unified Agent Scripts | Ensure policy consistency | ↓ Repeat contacts by 25% |
| 📉 CS Dashboard with repeat filters | Monitor & prevent recurrences | + Insight agility |

## 📈 Projected Outcomes

| Metric | Before | After (Projected) |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Repeat Contact Rate | 22% | ↓ 30–40% |
| First-Time Resolution | 38% (KYC) | ↑ 58–65% |
| CSAT | 3.6 | ↑ 4.4+ |
| Cost per Ticket | High (due to loops) | ↓ ~18% |
