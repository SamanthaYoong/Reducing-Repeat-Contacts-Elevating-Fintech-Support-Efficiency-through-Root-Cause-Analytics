# 📈 Case Study: Reducing Repeat Contacts in Fintech Support Operations

**Role Targeted**: Data Analyst – Customer Service Operations  
**Company**: OKX (Fintech & Crypto Exchange Platform)  
**Focus Areas**: Operational Efficiency | Root Cause Analysis | Customer Support Data | Process Optimization | Fintech User Behavior  

---

## 📈 Background

In a simulated high-volume fintech support environment inspired by OKX, I analyzed over **35,000+ anonymized support tickets** across 3 months.  
The objective: **Identify and reduce repeat contacts**, improve **first-time resolution (FTR)**, and enhance **customer experience**.

**Tech Stack**  
- `SQL` – Data extraction & anomaly detection  
- `Tableau` – Funnel & metric visualization  
- `Python (Pandas)` – Data Generation  
- `Excel` – Efficiency & churn modeling  

---

## 📈 Problem Statement

- ✅ **Repeat Contacts Increased**: 22% rise within 10 days after ticket resolution  
- ✅ **CSAT Dropped**: From 4.3 → 3.6 during the same period  
- ✅ **Top Repeat Categories**:
  - Wallet Transactions: 41%
  - KYC Verification: 31%

---

## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. Spike Analysis (SQL)
- Detected post-release spike in wallet-related contacts due to **delayed refund notifications**
- Caused **~41% of repeat contacts**

### 2. Funnel Drop-off (Tableau)
- **KYC support** had the lowest FTR: **38%** vs. average 64%
- Friction mainly from lack of real-time status updates

### 3. Policy Consistency (NLP Analysis)
- Found **28% script inconsistency** in agent replies
- Led to mixed messages & recontacts

## 📈 Recommendations

| Action | Purpose | Estimated Impact |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| ✅ Auto-notification for wallet refunds | Reduce uncertainty & loops | ↓ Wallet tickets by ~35% |
| ✅ KYC Real-time Tracker UI | Increase transparency | ↑ FTR by 20% |
| ✅ Unified Agent Scripts | Ensure policy consistency | ↓ Repeat contacts by 25% |
| ✅ CS Dashboard with repeat filters | Monitor & prevent recurrences | + Insight agility |

---

## 📈 Projected Outcomes

| Metric | Before | After (Projected) |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Repeat Contact Rate | 22% | ↓ 30–40% |
| First-Time Resolution | 38% (KYC) | ↑ 58–65% |
| CSAT | 3.6 | ↑ 4.4+ |
| Cost per Ticket | High (due to loops) | ↓ ~18% |

---

## 📈 OKX Role Fit

- ✅ Worked with CRM-like ticket structures for issue categorisation, resolution tracking, and escalation mapping (Zendesk equivalent)
- ✅ Analysed KYC and wallet transaction pain points, simulating payment issue flows tied to risk operations
- ✅ Applied Lean-like continuous improvement logic to reduce repeat contacts and improve CSAT/FTR through data-backed interventions

## 📈 Notes

This case study demonstrates my ability to:
- Dive deep into support metrics and detect inefficiencies
- Translate data into business & product recommendations
- Operate at the intersection of **analytics, service design, and product feedback loops**
